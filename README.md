Komeda: Framework for Interactive Algorithmic Music On Embedded Systems
====

Lets consider a music installation composed of 64 cubes with each one
comfortably handled with hands. Assume each cube plays music autonomously - it
was (individually) assigned music generation algorithm, an independent set of
sensors, indicators, a sound output and it possibly can communicate with its
neighbours. Participants of music experience have a possibility to grab a cube
and walk around with it. Cubes play react to the way they are handled and
another cubes in their vicinity. Though the description of such hypothetical
music installation is simple, the actual process of creation seems to be really
challenging.
